        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Avro Lancaster is considered one of the most iconic and effective bombers of World War II. 
            It played a critical role in the bombing campaigns against Germany, delivering a significant 
            portion of the Allied bombing effort. Its ability to carry heavy bomb loads, combined with its 
            durability and operational flexibility, contributed to its success in various missions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Where, the Lancaster remains a symbol of British wartime resolve and engineering excellence. 
            Today, a few airworthy Lancasters are preserved and occasionally flown for commemorative events, 
            serving as a living tribute to the aircraft's historical importance.
